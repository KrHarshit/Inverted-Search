Our Precious Earth
Beneath the sky so vast and blue,
Lies a world of emerald hue.
Rivers dance and mountains rise,
Under golden sunlit skies.

Forests whisper, oceans sing,
Nature’s gift in endless spring.
But heed her call, so soft yet strong,
Protect the Earth—it won’t last long.

Let’s cherish all, both great and small,
For this dear Earth, our home, our all.
