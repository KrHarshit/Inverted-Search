Title: The Last Message

In a quiet town nestled between misty hills, lived an old radio repairman named Arjun. He had long retired from the world, but every evening, he would sit in his workshop, tuning into static-filled frequencies, hoping to hear something—anything—from the past.

One monsoon evening, while adjusting a dusty ham radio, a faint voice crackled through:
"...this is Mira... if anyone hears me..."

His heart raced. Mira was his wife, lost in a stormy expedition twenty years ago. The world believed she was gone—but Arjun never gave up hope.

Night after night, the signal grew stronger. Coordinates. Fragments. Memories. And then one night, silence.

But Arjun didn’t despair. He packed his tools, left a note on the counter:
"Gone to find her. Back soon – A."

The town never saw him again.

But every year, on the same rainy night, a radio crackles to life in his old workshop, and a soft voice says,
"Found you, Arjun."
